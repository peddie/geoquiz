geoquiz
=======

Play geography trivia quizzes in your web browser.  In early development.

Installation
------------

Use (`stack`)[http://haskellstack.org].

Use
---

    stack build
    stack exec geoquiz

At the moment this will do nothing.  You have to have a web client
that will present the data to you in quiz form (work in progress) and
a populated database (work in progress).
